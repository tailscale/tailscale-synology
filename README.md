# Tailscale package for Synology NAS

Synology NAS package for Tailscale.

## Issue Tracker

File issues at: https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues

## Installation

See the [Synology installation
guide](https://tailscale.com/kb/1131/synology/) on the Tailscale
website.

## Building from source

The source code for the Synology packages is kept in [Tailscale's main
code repository](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale). You can
build the packages from source yourself with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale.git
cd tailscale
go run ./cmd/dist build synology
```

If everything worked you should have a directory called `dist` that
contains SPK files for all supported NASes and DSM versions.

## Compatibility

The package is confirmed to be working on various Synology models. For
recent models, the correct package is usually the DSM7 package for
`x86_64` or `armv8`. For older models based on 32-bit ARM, check the
[synology model list](docs/platforms.md) to find the synology platform
name.
